# YTSorter

Sorts YouTube playlists. Not done, somewhat functional.

TODO list: <br />
- [ ] Pay the 5$ for the Google store. <br />
- [ ] Some kind of progress indicator. <br />
- [ ] Call dursorter from popup.js <br />
- [ ] I somehow remove the remove from playlist button... <br />
- [ ] Big: better way of sorting multiple times (not having to reload in between sortings). Related: the remove from playlist and some other buttony things are gone after sorting. So sort without recking the page. <br />
- [ ] Maybe some constants to deal with YT changing their classes better. <br />
- [ ] Flip colors in icon, make that white  transparent. <br />
- [ ] Continually update because YouTube is bound to change stuff.
